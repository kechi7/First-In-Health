        <h1 class="head1">Why Care?</h1>
        <p class="para1">    Health inequity is a subject that effects all of us as a society especially first generation medical students. We hope this website can especially help first gen medical students have a significant perspective of this topic to better the healthcare industry. 
        
        Health inequity is a disadvantage to receiving medical care because of a socieconomic factor like race, ethnicity, and economic background. For instance, the Youth Risk Behavior Study that occured form 2009-2019 showed that kids who identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community faced higher levels of mental illness. Mothers who are below the poverty line often have birth related problems and might not be provided adequate resources during pregnancy. The CDC is actually using the CORE strategy to fight health inequity and health disparities.
